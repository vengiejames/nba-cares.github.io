<center>About us
Nothing But Nets is a global grassroots campaign to raise awareness and funding to fight malaria, a leading cause of death among<br> 
children in Africa. Nothing But Nets allows everyone from students to CEOs, <br>
bishops to basketball players to join the fight against malaria<br> 
by giving $10 to send a net and save a life<p>

About us
While the United Nations Foundation has been working with the UN to fight malaria for years,<br> 
it was Rick Reillyâ€™s column about malaria in Sports Illustrated challenging each of his readers to donate at least $10 to send<br> 
insecticide-treated bed nets,that led to the creation of the Nothing But Nets campaign in 2006.<p>

Over the years, the campaign has engaged hundreds of thousands of individuals to help<br>
 achieve the UN goal of ending malaria deaths in this generation.<br> 
 We work with a diverse group of partners, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, <br>
 the National Basketball Association's NBA Cares, The People of The United Methodist Church, <br>
 Major League Soccer's MLS WORKS, the Union for Reform Judaism and Junior Chamber International,<br>  among others.<p>

The success of Nothing But Nets is a testament to the power of passionate<br> 
people coming together to make the world a better, healthier place.<br> 
You can save a family. Your church, school, or sports team can save a community. <br>
Together, we can cover Africa with life-saving bed nets.<br>
How it Works<p>

Nothing But Nets is powered by your passion; it works because you do! Grab your family, <br>
friends, and classmates and work together to spread the word, raise funds, and share stories.<p>

Your $10 contribution goes towards the cost of purchasing a long-lasting,<br> insecticide-treated bed net, distributing it, and educating communities on its use.
<br>Nothing But Nets works with UN partners like UNICEF, the UN Refugee Agency, and the World Health Organization<br> to purchase nets and distribute them to countries in Africa. Net distributions are typically part of a wider<br> public health effort within a country coordinated by the Ministry of Health, the UN and other local and international organizations.<p>

Get started today! Send a net. Save a life. Together we can cover a continent. </center>
